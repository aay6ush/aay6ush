### Hey, guys! 👋

I'm a **"Problem Solver"** but people call me a **"Full-Stack"** engineer ;)

- 🛠️ Currently building [buildwise](https://buildwise.club)
- ⚙️ I mostly code: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.md`
- 🌍 Active on [X](https://x.com/aay6ush) and [Peerlist](https://peerlist.io/aay6ush)
- 💬 Ping me about **design**, **development** and **deployment**
